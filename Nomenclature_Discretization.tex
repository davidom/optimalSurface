Consider a discretization, $D$, defined on $S$, comprised of $n_p$
points, $P \in \left\{p_1,...,p_{n_p} \right\}$, and a non-overlapping,
non-degenerate, consistently oriented, conformal, triangular
connectivity $T \in \left\{t_1,...,t_{n_t} \right\}$. Each triangle in
$T$, $t_i$, is defined by points $\left(p_j, p_k, p_m\right)$, and edges
$\left(e_n, e_o, e_p\right)$. For the purposes of defining an edge in this
work, the ordering of the nodes does not matter.  However, the ordering of the
triangle connectivity (sometimes referred to as winding) is used to maintain
consistent orientation during topological operations and to define constraints
in the developed optimization strategy.

Each point, $p_i$, in $D$ is defined at a parametric coordinate,
$\left(u,v\right)_i$, and an edge is a straight line in both parametric
space and in ${\mathbb R}^3$. This is not the case for a discretization,
$D:{\mathbb R}^3$, which is mapped onto a surface, $S:{\mathbb R}^3$. In the
absence of a parameterization the mapping of an edge in ${\mathbb R}^3$ to a
curve (possibly a straight line, but not guaranteed) on a surface is an
ambiguous task which is outside the scope of this work.  Additionally, the
development of topological constraints for optimization, which will be detailed
later, would not be as straightforward as is possible when using a
parameterized, planar space.
