The concept of representation deficit is discussed in \cite{mclaurin13}
in the context of scale-independent measure of curve discretizations.
Here, the concept will be extended to two dimensions. It is important
that any criteria for refinement maintain scale independence. This is so
that the values for representation deficit can be compared between
different candidate operations. Below, representation deficit is defined
and discussed for four fundamental mesh operations: triangle split, edge
split, edge swap, and node smoothing.
