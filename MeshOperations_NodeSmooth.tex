\subsection{Nodal Movement}
In this paper, the focus is on using nodal movement in 
order to locally minimize the representation deficit in the surface mesh.  
It should be noted that, although a locally optimal mesh topology could 
also be obtained, computing such a topology would involve the solution of 
a discrete optimization problem (via integer programming) which would 
specify the relevant sequence of edge flips.  The discrete 
and continuous optimization problems could then be solved in an iterative, 
interleaving fashion.  However, such an approach would require significant 
additional computational expense.

For a node, $N_i$, the representation deficit is defined only by
comparing it to the node when located at another point in space. Here
the comparison is bound by limiting the range of comparison within the
edge-hull topologically adjacent to $N_i$. Formally, let $N_i$ be a node
in $D$ that is shared topologically by $n$ triangles, where $n$ is the
face-valence of $N_i$. The optimization for finding the optimal position
for $N_i$ is defined as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\underset{N_O}{\text{minimize}} \ O(N) & = &
-\sum{_{j=1}^{n_t-1}A\left(T_j\right)} \\
\text{subject to} \ N_{T_1} & > & 0 \\
N_{T_2} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_3} & > & 0 \\
& \vdots & \\
N_{T_{n-1}} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_n} & > & 0.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}
