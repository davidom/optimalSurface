\subsection{Nodal Smoothing}
For a node, $N_i$, the representation deficit can be defined only by
comparing it to the node when located at another point in space. Here
the comparison is bound by limiting the range of comparison within the
edge-hull topologically adjacent to $N_i$. Formally, let $N_i$ be a node
in $D$ that is shared topologically by $n$ triangles, where $n$ is the
face-valence of $N_i$. The optimization for finding the optimal position
for $N_i$ can be stated as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\underset{N_O}{\text{minimize}} \ O(N) & = &
-\sum{_{j=1}^{n_t-1}A\left(T_j\right)} \\
\text{subject to} \ N_{T_1} & > & 0 \\
N_{T_2} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_3} & > & 0 \\
& \vdots & \\
N_{T_{n-1}} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_n} & > & 0
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}
