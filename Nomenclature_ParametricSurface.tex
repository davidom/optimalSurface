In the field of surface mesh generation there exists an overwhelming
precedent for mapping physical space to parametric space and performing
the actual mesh generation in parametric space [CITE]. This strategy has
been proven to be efficient and accurate---with the assumption that the
parameterization is of reasonable quality. Here, mesh generation in
parametric space also enables the development of unambiguous
optimization constrains and objective functions. The search space for
the local optimization problem is straightforward and intuitive to
define---as well as efficient to search. Therefore, this method will be
developed for an orientable, parameterized surface,
$\vec{S}\left(u,v\right) : {\mathbb R}^2 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3$
