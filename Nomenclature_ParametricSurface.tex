I need a parametric surface so that I can maintain a valid topology.
Projection is not required since the topology gives me uv bounds. The
mesh generation is going on in parametric space. There is an
optimization function for creating the mesh in parametric space. Parametric
space is also great for optimization since you can write the topology
and optimization function constraints in uv space. Mapping a
discretization to a surface in general involved the determination of
``what'' an edge means on the surface---whether it's a geodesic line, or
what... If you can do this that's great but the development of a map
is not the purpose of this work so, for ease of presentation, a
parametric surface is used.

Consider an orientable, parameterized surface, $\vec{S}\left(u,v\right)
: {\mathbb R}^2 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3$.
