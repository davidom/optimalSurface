Edge flips are not refinements and Iâ€™m having a hard time justifying doing one? Tests are needed to determine if it converges to something that is good? Flip based on maximizing surface area.

A good argument (touchy-feely, need to prove at least suggest better) can be made that flipping to minimize the maximum angle gives smoothing and refinement a better chance at producing a more efficient representation (fewer triangles) but not necessarily more optimal (with respect to surface area).
