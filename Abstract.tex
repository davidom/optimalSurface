This work seeks to explore the concept of optimal mesh representation. Most mesh generation algorithms refine an initial discretization based on {\it a priori} error estimates or quality metrics. These mesh generation strategies focus on element quality -- with the justification being that downstream applications require high quality geometries in order to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The work presented here is contrasted with these traditional methods in that only the degree in which the discretization approximates the geometry is considered. A formal definition of fundamental mesh operations is developed with respect to optimal representation for a continuous, parameterized surface. A method of generating surface grids through constrained, local optimization is then detailed. Further discussion of robustness and mesh quality is also presented. Results are presented showing the developed algorithm to be effective at generating triangular meshes which are optimal with respect to {\it representation deficit}.
