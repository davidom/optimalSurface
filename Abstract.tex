This work explores optimal mesh representation of surfaces using 
triangular surface meshes. 
Most mesh generation algorithms refine an initial discretization based on 
{\it a priori} error estimates or quality metrics. These mesh generation 
strategies focus on element quality -- with the justification being that 
downstream applications require high quality geometries in order to 
achieve a desired level of accuracy. The work presented here is contrasted 
with these traditional methods in that only the degree in which the 
discretization approximates the geometry is considered. A formal 
definition of fundamental mesh operations is developed with respect to 
optimal representation for a continuous, parameterized surface. A method 
of generating surface grids through constrained, local optimization is 
then detailed. Further discussion of robustness and mesh quality is also 
presented. Results are presented showing the developed algorithm to be 
effective at generating triangular surface meshes which are optimal with 
respect to {\it representation deficit}.
