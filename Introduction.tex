Computational design and analysis has become a fundamental part of industry and academia for use in research, development, and manufacturing. In general, the accuracy of computational analysis depends heavily on the fidelity of the computational representation of a real-world object or phenomenon. However, the task of creating high fidelity models of an actual geometry can be time-consuming--sometimes consuming up to seventy-five percent of the time required to produce a solution [REFERENCE]. This work seeks to explore the concept of optimal surface grid generation through the development of a formal description of fundamental mesh operations. These mesh operations (triangle split, edge split, edge collapse, edge swap, and vertex smoothing) were developed with respect to optimal representation of a discrete element for a continuous, parameterized surface. The concept of discrete element quality is also defined with respect to optimal representation. The above concepts are contrasted with traditional methods for grid generation through direct comparison of representation optimality and efficiency.
