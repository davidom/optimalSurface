The concept of representation deficit was discussed in \cite{mclaurin13}
in the context of scale-independent measure of curve discretizations.
Here, the concept will be extended to two dimensions. It is important
that any criteria for refinement maintain scale indepdence. This is so
that the values for representation deficit can be compared between
different candidate operations. Below, representation deficit is defined
and discussed for four fundamental mesh operations: triangle split, edge
split, edge swap, and node smoothing.

\subsubsection{Triangle Split}
A triangle is a planar object, and is representing a possibly non-planar
portion of a surface. Any triangle, with area $A_T$, in the
discretization can have at most the same area as the portion of the
surface which it represents, $A_S$. Therefore, the representation
deficit for a triangle, $RD_T$, can be defined as $RD_T = \frac{A_S -
A_T}{A_T}$. Note that the areas are calculated in ${\mathbb R}^3$. The
difference in surface area, $\left(A_S - A_T\right)$, is normalized by
$A_T$ so that the result is scale independent. Also, this is a
representation {\it deficit} since $A_S \ge A_T$ is always true.

In order to apply the above definition of representation deficit to a
mesh generation, a replacement for $A_S$ must be determined since the
area of the surface represented by $A_S$ is not always able to be
determined --- or, most often, the area calculation is impractical.
Generally, in order to reduce the representation deficit for a triangle
the triangle is split by inserting an interior point. Any point that is
inserted into the interior of the triangle would decrease the
representation deficit --- or at worst it will remain the same. However,
the determination of where to split the triangle should be done in such
a way that the representation deficit is minimized. This strategy of
refinement, refining each triangle in such a way that the representation
deficit is locally minimized, would take advantage of the optimal
substructure the discrete topology.

The process of determining where to split a triangle is defined here by
a locally optimizing an objective function defined for a triangle: Let
$S(u,v)$ be a parameterized surface, $D$ be be a discretization of the
surface, and $T$ be a triangle (included in $D$) defined by an ordered
tuple of nodes, $\left(n_i, n_j, n_k\right)$. These nodes are ordered
such that the triangle normal is positive. Specifically, if $\vec{V_0} =
\left\{n_j - n_i \right\}$ and $\vec{V_1} = \left\{n_k - n_i\right\}$
then the triangle normal, $N_T = \vec{V_0} \times \vec{V_1}$, is
positive. Note that a two-dimensional cross-product (or two-dimensional
curl) is a scalar quantity. Additionally, let a node on the interior of
$T$ be defined as $n_O$. The four nodes, $n_i$, $n_j$, $n_k$, and $n_O$
define three triangles, $T_i\left(n_i,n_j,n_0\right), T_j\left(n_j, n_k,
n_0\right), T_k\left(n_k, n_i, n_0\right)$. If $A(T)$ is a function
that calculates the area of a triangle in $\left(x,y,z\right)$ space,
then the optimization problem for finding the optimal position for $n_0$
in $T$ can be stated as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\underset{n_O}{\text{minimize}} \ O(T) & = & - \frac{A\left(T_i\right) + A\left(T_j\right) + A\left(T_k\right) }{ A\left(T\right) }\\
\text{subject to} \ N_{T_i} & > & 0 \\
N_{T_j} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_k} & > & 0 \\
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}

It should be noted that this definition of representation deficit would be difficult to derive or express for a topological entity other than a triangle. This is due to the inherent ambiguity in the definition of not only the surface area, but also the surface representation of (possibly) non-planar elements, e.g. non-planar, or skew, quadrilateral. [MORE POSSIBLY]

\subsubsection{Edge Split}
An edge in parametric space represents a (possible) curve on the
surface. Any edge, with length $L_E$, can have at most the same length
as the portion of the surface which it represents, $L_S$. Therefore, the
representation deficit for an edge, $RD_E$, can be defined as $RD_E =
\frac{L_S - L_E}{L_E}$. Note that the lengths are calculated in
${\mathbb R}^3$. The difference in length, $\left(L_S - L_E\right)$, is
normalized by $L_E$ so that the result is scale independent. Also, this
is a representation {\it deficit} since $L_S \ge L_E$ is always true;

In order to apply the above definition of representation deficit to mesh
generation, a replacement for $L_S$ must be determined since the area of
the surface represented by $L_S$ is not always able to be determined --
or, most often, the arc-length calculation is impractical.
Generally, in order to reduce the representation deficit for an edge 
the edge is split by inserting an interior point. Any point that is
inserted into the interior of the edge would decrease the
representation deficit --- or at worst it will remain the same. However,
the determination of where to split the edge should be done in such
a way that the representation deficit is minimized. This strategy of
refinement, refining each edge in such a way that the representation
deficit is locally minimized, would take advantage of the optimal
substructure of the discrete topology. A method for generating a locally
optimal edge split is detailed in \cite{mclaurin12,mclaurin13}[OTHERS].

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \center{\includegraphics[height=1.4in]
    {Figures/EdgeSplit.png}}
  \caption{Edge Split}
\end{figure}

In addition, the fact that an edge split will change the surface area of
the discretization should be considered. Since the overall justification
of this work is reduce the {\it area} representation deficit of a
discretization, the representation deficit will not be defined for an
edge but for an edge-split. Therefore, for a given edge, only the
edge-split that minimizes {\it area} representation deficit is
considered.  . The process of determining where to split a triangle is
defined here by locally optimizing an objective function defined for an
edge-split.  Let $E\left(n_i,n_j\right)$ be an edge in $D$ that is
shared topologically by two triangles, $T_i\left(n_i,n_j,n_k\right)$,
and $T_j\left(n_i,n_l,n_j\right)$. Additionally, let a node on the
interior of the edge be defined as $n_O$. The five nodes,
$\left\{n_i,n_j,n_k,n_l,n_O\right\}$ define four triangles,
$T_a\left(n_i,n_O,n_k\right)$, $T_b\left(n_O,n_j, n_k\right)$,
$T_c\left(n_i,n_l,n_O\right)$, $T_d\left(n_O,n_l,n_j\right)$.  The
optimization problem for finding the optimal position for $n_O$ on $E$
can be stated as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\underset{n_O}{\text{minimize}} \ O(E) & = & - \frac{ A\left(T_a\right) + A\left(T_b\right) + A\left(T_c\right) + A\left(T_d\right) }{ A\left(T_i\right) + A\left(T_j\right) } \\
\text{subject to} \ N_{T_a} & > & 0 \\
N_{T_b} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_c} & > & 0 \\
N_{T_d} & > & 0 \\
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}

In considering the edge swap operation it became apparent that the constraint of finding a candidate point, $P_c$, that topologically lies on the edge, $E$, is an ``implicit'' constraint. Is it required that $P_c$ lie on $E$ or should $P_c$ be allowed to be inserted where most appropriate in the hull formed by the two triangles topologically adjacent to $E$?. [DO I EVEN WANT TO MENTION THIS? THEN I'LL HAVE TO GET INTO, ``WELL WHY CONSTRAIN THE SEARCH TO ONLY TWO TRIANGLES? WHY NOT LET THE NODE TRAVEL UNTIL IT FINDS THE BEST PLACE?'' AND THEN I'D HAVE TO COMPARE METHODS AND MORE CODING... IT'S INTERESTING, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ROOM HERE. PRACTICALLY, EDGE SPLITS ARE USUALLY NEEDED SINCE THE TRIA SPLITS AND RECONNECTIONS TAKE CARE OF MOSTLY EVERYTHING.]

\subsubsection{Edge Swap}
Is it possible to have an optimal topology? If so, then it should be
reachable through repeated edge flipping. Therefore, we should be able
to write some sort of formulation for a pair of triangles and go from
there? [SUZANNE] Comment: for the sake of not doing any more coding, if
your ethics can let you come to the conclusion that this is either not
possible or not practical then this would fit into the
logic/justification in the next section.

\subsubsection{Nodal Smoothing}
For a node, $N_i$, the representation deficit can be defined only by
comparing it to the node when located at another point in space. Here
the comparison is bound by limiting the range of comparison within the
edge-hull topologically adjacent to $N_i$. Formally, let $N_i$ be a node
in $D$ that is shared topologically by $n$ triangles, where $n$ is the
face-valence of $N_i$. The optimization for finding the optimal position
for $N_i$ can be stated as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\underset{N_O}{\text{minimize}} \ O(N) & = &
-\sum{_{j=1}^{n_t-1}A\left(T_j\right)} \\
\text{subject to} \ N_{T_1} & > & 0 \\
N_{T_2} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_3} & > & 0 \\
& \vdots & \\
N_{T_{n-1}} & > & 0 \\ 
N_{T_n} & > & 0
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}
