There's no reason to constrain the refinement along the line defined in parametric space by the edge on the surface. The refinement should be in the four-point hull instead.

The above is a good argument but is not consistent with the definition of representation-deficit in context of optimal substructure. Any point placement that does not fit into the above definition is equivalent to smoothing and will be discussed in that section.
