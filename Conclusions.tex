{\bf{Dave:  The future work part of this section starts here.}} There are 
several possible directions for future work.  One avenue for future work 
is to further improve the optimization algorithm in the following two 
ways.  First, optimization could be employed in the determination of which 
mesh operation to perform at each stage of the optimization procedure.  
Second, the objective function could be modified in order to generate 
surface meshes that simultaneously minimize the representation deficit and 
optimize the mesh quality.  Another possibility for future research would 
be to extend the surface mesh generation algorithm to handle the volume 
mesh generation case so that a hierarchical approach for mesh generation 
(i.e., edge grid~\cite{mclaurin13} $\mapsto$ surface 
mesh~\cite{mclaurin14} $\mapsto$ volume mesh) could be employed. This 
would allow for optimization of each stage of the mesh generation 
procedure.  Finally, parallelization of the algorithm would allow for 
optimal generation of very large surface meshes such as those required by

applications.
