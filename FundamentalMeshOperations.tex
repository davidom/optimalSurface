\subsection{Boundary Refinement}
[Is there a section needed on this? It'd be straightforward to talk about
but would be pretty repetitive and I don't have it coded up yet. If I do
talk about it then due diligence says I should show some results and
there are already tons of variables to consider. This might get left out
due to space concerns.]
[This should be an argument for applying [CITE SELF] to the boundary
curves first because the interior of the surface is not what the
boundary curves are really trying to represent]

\section{Element Quality}
Element quality is not considered here, only the optimal representation
of the underlying geometry. Methods for triangular mesh improvement are
myriad---so no effort was made to contribute to that area of research.
