%\subsection{Boundary Refinement}
%[Is there a section needed on this? It'd be straightforward to talk about
%but would be pretty repetitive and I don't have it coded up yet. If I do
%talk about it then due diligence says I should show some results and
%there are already tons of variables to consider. This might get left out
%due to space concerns.]
%[This should be an argument for applying [CITE SELF] to the boundary
%curves first because the interior of the surface is not what the
%boundary curves are really trying to represent]
