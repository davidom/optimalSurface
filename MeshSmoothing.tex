Smoothing to maximized delta-representation deficit is equivalent to smoothing to maximize surface area--which is not equivalent to minimizing representation deficit. Think of points on the exterior of the cylinder. If the nodes are ``twisted'' around the cylinder to increase the surface area of each triangle, this satisfies the delta-representation deficit but does nothing to actually improve the representation of the surface.

This is true, but cannot happen when this definition is applied iteratively. I can show examples for smoothing with respect to representation deficit actually decreased the surface area considerably. (peaks at 0.3 limit)
