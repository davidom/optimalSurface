Smoothing to maximized delta-representation deficit is equivalent to smoothing to maximize surface area--which is not equivalent to minimizing representation deficit. Think of points on the exterior of the cylinder. If the nodes are ``twisted'' around the cylinder to increase the surface area of each triangle, this satisfies the delta-representation deficit but does nothing to actually improve the representation of the surface.
