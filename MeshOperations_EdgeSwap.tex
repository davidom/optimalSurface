\subsection{Edge Swap}
Is it possible to have an optimal topology? If so, then it should be
reachable through repeated edge flipping. Therefore, we should be able
to write some sort of formulation for a pair of triangles and go from
there? [SUZANNE] Comment: for the sake of not doing any more coding, if
your ethics can let you come to the conclusion that this is either not
possible or not practical then this would fit into the
logic/justification in the next section.
